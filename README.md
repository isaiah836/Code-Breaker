# Code-Breaker
decoder I think?
1.By hand, choose 10 single code words of your choice, and write down a hint for each word.
2.Create a new C++ project called Keywords
3.This Code Breaker Training Simulation Program should give the user directions and tell them what it is and how to use it based of the background description above.
4.Then your Code Breaker Training Simulation Program should randomly select 3 of the 10 words that are coded in your program.
5.Your code breaker will scramble each word on the fly and different each run randomly.
6.Now make the user try to solve each one of the three randomly picked coded word from your random list.
7.Each turn you should give your user feedback on if they got the guess correct or not.
8.You should also offer the user help.
9.At the end, you should display their stats and ask if they would like to try again.
10.After you have a project, publish your code to a new GitHub repository.
